### To do
* Trouble shoot crs systems. Polygons not in the same place when loaded into Qgis as WGS84. 
* Fix handeling of minimum number of polygon values, currently works but in a stupid way. 
* Integrate R code using `rpy2` rather than subprocess calls.
* Add the ability to resize and move the draw map while running the app.
* Genral tidying up of code.
